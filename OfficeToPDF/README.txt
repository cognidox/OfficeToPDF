  Templates:
  ----------

  When converting documents with Word, the /template switch can be used to open
  the source document with a specific Word template file. If no /template switch
  is set, the default Normal.dotm template will be used.
  
  The template path must be the full path to the template file. e.g.
    /template c:\users\fred\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\example.dotx
  
  For more information about Office template paths, see:
  http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/word-help/about-document-template-locations-HP003082725.aspx


  Error Codes:
  ------------

  The following error codes are returned by OfficeToPDF. Note that multiple errors are
  returned as a bitmask, so bitwise operations can test for multiple errors.

  0     - Success
  1     - Failure
  2     - Unknown Error
  4     - File protected by password
  8     - Invalid arguments
  16    - Unable to open the source file
  32    - Unsupported file format
  64    - Source file not found
  128   - Output directory not found
  256   - The requested worksheet was not found
  512   - Unable to use an empty worksheet
  1024  - Unable to modify or open a protected PDF

  To check for a specific error code after calling officetopdf.exe, use the batch
  "SET /A" command. e.g.

      SET /A "PASSWORDFAIL=(%ERRORLEVEL% & 4)"
      IF %PASSWORDFAIL% NEQ 0 (
          ECHO Password failed
      )


  Handling Dialogs:
  -----------------

  When converting, the environment variable OFFICE2PDF_AUTO_CONVERT will be set
  with a value of 1. The existence of this variable can be used by VBA/macro code
  in Office documents to indicate the document is being processed in an un-attended
  way.

  For instance, the following AutoOpen Word macro will show a message box whenever
  a document is opened:

    Sub AutoOpen()
        MsgBox "You have opened the document"
    End Sub

  OfficeToPDF will stall until the message box is closed. To avoid this, the macro
  can be updated to check for the OFFICE2PDF_AUTO_CONVERT environment variable.

    Sub AutoOpen()
        If Environ("OFFICE2PDF_AUTO_CONVERT") = "" Then
            MsgBox "You have opened the document"
        End If
    End Sub
